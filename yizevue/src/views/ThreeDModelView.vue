          Russia has steadily been making gains in the eastern Donbas region,
          which Russia’s President Vladimir Putin aims to capture in full.
          Reuters, citing open source data, reported that Russia has been
          advancing at its fastest pace in at least a year. Ukraine’s
          Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said the situation on the front
          line “remains difficult” and certain areas “require constant renewal
          of resources of Ukrainian units” in a statement on Telegram Saturday
          morning.
